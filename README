To load the RSS must first put the beginning of your XML file:

prefix: parameter for differentiating flows between them if you have several
feed: This is the URL of your RSS or ATOM
limit: the maximum number of news you want to recover

Then you call the properties as follows:

$INFO[Window.property (RSS.X.Title)]

where X is the number of the news you want to recover
where Y is the prefix to differentiate them flow (optional)

There are properties defined:
      [Y.]RSS.X.Title: title of the news
      [Y.]RSS.X.Date: date of the news
      [Y.]RSS.X.Desc: What's in the news
      [Y.]RSS.X.Image: Img File-related news, is False if no picture
      [Y.]RSS.X.Video: Link to video, is empty if no video
      [Y.]RSS.X.MultiImages : Path to directory containing images attached to item (usage in MultiImage control or Slideshow builtin), content images only if SlideShowable is set to true
      [Y.]RSS.X.ImageCount : count of images attached to item
      [Y.]RSS.X.SlideShowable : if set to true it means we can use MultiImage control or builtin Slideshow function
      [Y.]RSS.count : holds count of RSS items passed to skin (usefull if script will return less items than skinner wanted - limit parameter)
